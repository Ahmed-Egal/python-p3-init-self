1. Dog.__init__ with Name and Breed defaulting to "Mutt"
Define a Dog class in lib/dog.py. In the class, define an __init__ method that accepts an argument for the dog's name. That argument should be stored within a self.name attribute.

Additionally, Dog.__init__ should accept a second optional argument for the dog's breed stored in an attribute self.breed. When no breed is provided, it should default to "Mutt".

2. Person.__init__ with a Name
Define a Person class in lib/person.py. In the class, define an __init__ method that accepts an argument for the person's name. That argument should be stored within a self.name attribute.
